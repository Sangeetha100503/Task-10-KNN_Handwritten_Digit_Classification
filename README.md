# Task-10-KNN_Handwritten_Digit_Classification
This project demonstrates handwritten digit classification using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the Sklearn Digits dataset. The dataset consists of 8×8 grayscale images of digits (0–9). The workflow includes data loading, visualization, train–test splitting, feature scaling using StandardScaler, and training the KNN model. Multiple K values (3, 5, 7, 9) are evaluated to identify the optimal K based on accuracy. Model performance is analyzed using an Accuracy vs K plot and a Confusion Matrix, and final predictions are visualized on test images.
